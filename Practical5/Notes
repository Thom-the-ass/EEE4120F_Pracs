We are making a TSC to read data from an adc

input lines 
*clk (updates on posedge)
*trigger
*reads from 8 bit reg
* has a 32 bit timer register
* 32 bit ring buffer

trigger occurs when then the a value from input is greater than the configures trigger threshold

when it has been triggered, the current timer value (stored in TRIGTM register)
